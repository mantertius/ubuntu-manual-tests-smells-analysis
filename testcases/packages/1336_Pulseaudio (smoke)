Test-case name: pulseaudio/pulseaudio-001
Tests should be performed to make sure PulseAudio is properly recognising your audio hardware.
<dl>
    <dt>Check the log output of PulseAudio, either in syslog, or following the instructions on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio/Log</dt>
        <dd>The log output should contain references to module-udev-detect detecting either a pci or USB audio device</dd>
    <dt>Check the output of the command "pactl list"</dt>
        <dd>The pactl list command should list loaded modules and their parameters, as well as all current sinks, sources, and their current volume, device information, and output profile</dd>
    <dt>Open up the sound settings window from the sound indicator and check both the output and input pages.</dt>
        <dd>The output and input pages should list all detected hardware, both internal and USB, and allow for volume adjustment</dd>
