<dl>
    <dt>Ensure that Network Manager is running and that no networks are currently connected</dt>
    <dt>Open Terminal</dt>
    <dt>Ensure wireless is enabled</dt>
    <dt>After approximately 30 seconds, open the network manager</dt>
        <dd>Your wireless network is visible</dd>
    <dt>Connect to your wireless network</dt>
    <dt>Run ifconfig in the terminal</dt>
        <dd>A new network interface (e.g. "wlan0") is present and has received an IP address</dd>
    <dt>Run <code>route -n</code> . Note the IP address in the Gateway column. (not "0.0.0.0")</dt>
    <dt>Run <code>ping -c 5 [gateway]</code> where [gateway] is the IP address of the Gateway, above. </dt>
        <dd>The command reports "5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received"</dd>

<dl>
    <dt>Run <code>sudo ifconfig [interface] [staticIP] </code> where [interface] is the interface name (e.g. wlan) and [staticIP] is a valid unused IP address on the current network. (If you are on a home network try using the previously used IP address, (still listed on the terminal) (Consult your network administrator if you do not know such an address.)</dt>
    <dt>Run <code>ifconfig</code>. Verify that the network device is again listed (e.g. wlan) and has the IP ([staticIP]) address listed as given above.</dt>
    <dt>Run <code>ping -c 5 [gateway]</code> where [gateway] is the IP address of the Gateway, above. </dt>
        <dd>The command reports "5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received"</dd></dl>
